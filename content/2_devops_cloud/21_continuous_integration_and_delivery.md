Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) is the process for which your software components are built from code, integrated, tested, released, deployed and ultimately delivered to end-users. CI/CD pipelines are the software assembly line that orchestrates the building of your software. This CI/CD pipeline line requires infrastructure. Cloud computing has allowed this infrastructure to become dynamic and ephemeral. On cloud infrastructure, your CI/CD pipelines scale up and down to meet your software delivery demands. It saves costs by providing the right amount of cloud infrastructure just as it is needed. This is further realized by using cloud-native technologies like Kubernetes and extending across clouds and on-premise datacenters. Google Cloud Build is a Google cloud technologies that your pipelines can utilize to run CI and CD tasks.
