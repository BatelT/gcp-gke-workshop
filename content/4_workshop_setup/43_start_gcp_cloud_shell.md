You can configure `gcloud` CLI on your local machine, however that is beyond the scope of this workshop.

Fortunately, google provides an easy way to start a pre configured shell inside your google cloud console. We will use this mechanism.

On the top right, you see a `>_` icon, click on it and it will start a shell that is pre-configured with your credentials.


This command should result in successful install.
