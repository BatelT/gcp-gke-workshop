Before we get started on building, publishing and deploying our NPM application, we must set up our workshop environment. In this setup section, we will:

- Set up our GCP environment.
- Clone our workshop GitHub repository which contains our code.
- Configure our JFrog Platform instance (Artifactory and Xray).
